PyAI is a script written on the popular programming language Python.  Files "Random" and "Nodes" are not meant to be viewed.  how to use:  adjust settings in "Settings", then go to "ByteLearn" or "BitLearn" to progress the learning of the AI.  once you are satisfied with the amount of learning, you then may end the progress in the intended manner, and go to the other program "BitNetworkPostLearn" or "ByteRun". once there you can use the AI in the same way as before except it doesn't progress.
