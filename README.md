# PyAI
an AI script written in the popular programming language Python.  The Files "Random" and "Nodes" are needed no matter the use.  the Files "BitLearn" and "BitNetworkPostLearn" are the first iteration of this AI System, "Bitlearn" uses a QnA style interface (Input,Correct Answer are given).  it also uses a Boolean data type for an input.  "BitNetworkPostLearn" is what is used after the learning process to test the AI, It uses the output of Bitlearn(printed to console) to dictate what the AI believes the answer is.
