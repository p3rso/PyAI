InputAmount = 9 	#No Limits
Layers = 50		#recommended to be over 2x"InputAmount" for best results

mode = "BYTE"     # "BYTE" or "BIT"

#Inputamount is, simply, the amount of inputs to the network.
#Layers is the complexity of the network, as it increases, the network gets more complex
#Depth is the "craziness" of the AI.  Increase it to get wider varying results in the learn stage.
#Mode is the input type, either Bytes or Bits.
#NOTE: INPUTAMOUNT, LAYERS, & MODE MUST NOT CHANGE BETWEEN LEARNING AND TESTING PHASE, DEPTH ONLY USED IN LEARNING.
#All of these should be numbers, or integers Except for mode, which is a string.
